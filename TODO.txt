Quaternion rotation = Quaternion.Euler(0f, 180f, 0f);

If collider too small, bullet won't register as prob too fast

**Bugs**
Turn smooth hand animation on for hand prefabs
- Fix hash not found error
- Find where to get the Left HandAvatar for animator component

Stop reaction time on enemy hit

AI animation causes model to slowly fall through the ground - possibly due to high playback speed

**Later**
Implement a short tutorial before game
Have the UI follow the screen like a on-screen hud
Refactor gun and target scripts into a superclass and extendeds
Stop enemy Cowboy shooting after being hit in a better way by diabling var timer
Fine-tune AI animation to sync better with bullet shot
Change Draw! implementation so that can show reaction time immediately
Make it so if bullet hits ground, it disappears
Make holster map to player position on load
Find a better solution to disabling gun interaction before duel - make gun in holster a model then replace as duel starts?
